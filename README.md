Using this repository to store all my python practice problems. Comments not made on the early problems.

##### Why Am I Learning Python?

In order for me to kickstart my journey into A.I./machine learning, I figured python would be a handy language to learn now that I've had experience in Java and C++ via university courses.

##### How Am I Learning Python?

I'm currently looking over elementary problems found on websites, such as https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html . I'm hoping to get the basics of python down and possibly start a *very* small side project and work my way up there.


##### Goals

- Learn fundamentals of python (including naming convention, etc)
- Start a side project (in any field, whether it be a simple GUI game, a recreation of my early university projects, or perhaps a machine learning gig)
- Ultimately use this knowledge in future endeavors (whether it be personal or for my career)
