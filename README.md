Using this repository to store all my python practice/test files. Comments not made on the early problems.

##### Why Am I Learning Python?

In order for me to kickstart my journey into A.I./machine learning, I figured python would be a handy language to learn now that I've had experience in Java and C++ via university courses.

##### How Am I Learning Python?

I'm currently checking out **"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"** and also stumbling upon random modules (such as pyautogui) and tinkering with them, testing out different codes based on what I'm feeling at the moment.

Previous methods of learning:

- elementary programming problems via adrian: https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html 


##### Goals

- Learn fundamentals of python (including naming convention, etc)
- Start a side project (in any field, whether it be a simple GUI game, a recreation of my early university projects, or perhaps a machine learning gig)
- Ultimately use this knowledge in future endeavors (whether it be personal or for my career)
